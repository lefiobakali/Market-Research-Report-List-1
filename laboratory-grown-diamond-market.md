<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Laboratory Grown Diamond Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>CVD Diamonds</li><li>HTHP Diamonds</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The laboratory-grown diamond market primarily consists of two types: Chemical Vapor Deposition (CVD) diamonds and High-Temperature High-Pressure (HTHP) diamonds. CVD diamonds are produced by dissolving carbon-rich gases into a plasma, allowing carbon atoms to crystallize in a controlled environment. In contrast, HTHP diamonds mimic the natural diamond formation process by applying high pressure and temperature to carbon sources. Both types offer sustainable, ethically sourced alternatives to mined diamonds, catering to diverse consumer preferences and industries.</p></p>
